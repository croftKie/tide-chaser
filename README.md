<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Tide Chaser is a web application written in JavaScript, with NodeJS utilised for back-end development (proxy server for API security and caching / database communication).
- Provides global surf data.
- Allows user to search any break in the world and receive 7 day forecast.
- Save favourite breaks for quick reference later.
- Save your board size to adjust wave ranking.

Key Points:

- Written in vanilla JavaScript.
- GSAP for animation & SASS for styling
- Includes data-caching for reduced API load.
- NodeJS backend for API safety.

If you have any tools or additions you would like to see included in Tide Chaser, let me know via the links above! :)
